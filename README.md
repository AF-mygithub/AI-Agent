# NVIDA AI Agent Developer Contest: Integration of Image Description and Object Detection

Project Overview
This project showcases the integration of image description and object detection capabilities. The notebook combines Large Language Model (mixtral-8x 7b) with Computer Vision Model (Faster R-CNN) to generate detailed descriptoin of uploaded images, identifying and describing objects within these images.

## Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to leverage NVIDIA's state-of-the-art technologies to enhance image understanding through a synergistic approach. By integrating image description and object detection, the project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for various applications, including automated content generation, enhanced accessibility, and intelligent image search.

## Features

- **Image Description**: Generates detailed textual descriptions of images using Large Language Model: Mixtral-8x 7b.
- **Object Detection**: Identifies and labels objects within images using Computer Vision model: Faster R-CNN.
- **Integration**: Combines both functionalities to produce detailed descriptions and  object detections.
